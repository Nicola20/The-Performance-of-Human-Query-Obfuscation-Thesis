\subsection{Why Gamification?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ''One of the earlier works done on adapting gameplay practices within the workplace can be traced back to 1984, when Charles Coonradt explored the value of adding game-play elements at work through his book ''The Game of Work''. \cite{game_work} \\
    Coonradt addressed the question, ''Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at their chosen sport or recreational pursuit than they would work at a job where they were beeing paid?'' He then boiled it down to five conclusions that lead to hobbies being more preferable to work.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearly defined goals
        \item Better scorekeeping and scorecards
        \item More frequent feedback
        \item A higher degree of personal choice of methods
        \item Consistent coaching''
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Human-Focused Design: The Better Term for Gamification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ''Human-Focused Design optimizes for human motivation in a system as opposed to optimizing for pure functional efficiency within the system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Conquests of Gamification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In a few short years, gamification has reached a social tipping point and is starting to creep into every aspect of our lives - from education, work, marketing, parenting, sustainability, all the way to healthcare and scientific research:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The U.S. Armed Forces now spends more money on recruitment games than any other marketing platform
        \item Volkswagen generated 33 million web visits and 119,000 new ideas through it's People Car Project to design the ''perfect car''.''
    \end{itemize}
    There are quite some more examples. A list can be found at \url{https://yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/} and stats can be found at \url{https://yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/gamification-stats-figures/}.
    \item ''According to the Entertainment Software Association, 70\% of major employers are already using gamification to enhance performance and training at their companies.''
    \item In a similar report, the market research firm Gartner predicted that 70\% of Fortune 500 firms would use Gamification by the end of 2014.''
    \item ''Unfortunately, in the same report, Gartner also predicted that 80\% of those gamified efforts will fail due to bad design[...].''
\end{itemize}
