# Abstract

The internet is a great source to learn new things and many people use search engines to answer their information needs. However, search engines like Google save every search query in query logs which poses a risk to the privacy of users. Many different approaches exist that try to improve the privacy of searchers by distorting search profiles or hiding the user's identity. But, all of these approaches have weaknesses and need improvement. In this thesis, we research how well humans are able to obfuscate sensitive queries while still retrieving relevant web pages. Therefore, we developed City of Rebellion, a web game on the ClueWeb12 in which users have to obfuscate a given sensitive query without using any of its terms. For an obfuscated query, our game assigns points depending on the result quality of the formulated query. To help the player with their obfuscations, a list of useful search terms is provided along with a relevant document. From the data we collected in a pilot study with 72 players, we conclude that the participants were able to obfuscate sensitive queries while still retrieving relevant documents but only with the help of the given keywords.
