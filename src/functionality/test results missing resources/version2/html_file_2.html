<h3 class="ccmainh3">Antibiotics</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Health News" height="100" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080720183909im_/http://www.health-news-and-information.com/3lourdesnet/libv/z10.jpg" width="120"/>Antibiotics are an essential weapon in the war against disease. But it's important to remember that an antibiotic is not a cure-all.</p>
<p>For one thing, antibiotics do not fight infections caused by a virus; they work only against infections caused by bacteria. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fo09.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Microorganisms</a>") That means that if someone has a simple cold, without any further complications, an antibiotic won't be much help. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp09.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">The Common Cold</a>") In fact, if an antibiotic is used too often, bacteria can actually become resistant to it. A case in point is the recent upsurge of antibiotic resistant staph infections. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp74.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Staph &amp; MRSA</a>")</p>
<p>That's why it's so important to use antibiotics correctly. Here are some basic guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians:</p>
<ul class="ccul">
<li>Colds and flu (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp15.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Influenza</a>") are caused by viruses. Antibiotics won't help.</li>
<li>Cough or bronchitis are almost always caused by viruses. If you have a lung condition or the illness lasts a long time, it could be caused by bacteria. Then your doctor might try an antibiotic. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp88.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Acute Bronchitis</a>")</li>
<li>Most sore throats are caused by viruses and don't require antibiotics. Strep throat is caused by bacteria and requires treatment with antibiotics. A throat swab and a lab test are needed before your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp30.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Sore Throat and Strep Throat</a>")</li>
<li>There are many types of ear infections. Antibiotics are used for some, but not all. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fk19.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Otitis Media</a>")</li>
<li>Infected tonsils and adenoids are sometimes treated with antibiotics. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fk33.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Tonsils and Adenoids</a>")</li>
<li>Sinus infections - Even if you have a runny nose, or yellow or green mucus coming from your nose, you may not need an antibiotic. Antibiotics should only be used for severe infections or infections that last more than 2 weeks, since these may be caused by bacteria. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp32.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Sinusitis</a>")</li>
<li>There are some skin infections, such as impetigo (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fk34.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Impetigo</a>"), that are caused by bacteria. Antibiotics may be prescribed for them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="cclibheader">Talk with your doctor</h4>
<p>If your doctor does prescribe antibiotics, here are some suggestions from the American Medical Association:</p>
<ul class="ccul">
<li>Ask about side effects - Antibiotics can cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain or allergic reaction, so it's important to discuss this with the doctor beforehand and to know what to do if you do develop symptoms. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fp29.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Diarrhea</a>" "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fi12.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Allergies</a>")</li>
<li>Ask about potential interactions - Make sure your doctor is aware of any medications you are currently taking, either prescription or over-the-counter. Seniors, who may be taking a number of different medications, should be especially cautious about potential interactions. (Read about "<a href="/cache?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-news-and-information.com%2F3lourdesnet%2Flibv%2Fs14.shtml&amp;index=cw09&amp;raw">Drug Interaction Precautions</a>") Also, ask whether it's best to take a prescribed antibiotic on an empty stomach or with meals, as well as whether or not you need to avoid certain foods or beverages while taking the drug.</li>
<li>Complete the dose - People sometimes stop taking an antibiotic when they feel better. However, even if the symptoms go away, the bacteria may still linger, so it's best to take an antibiotic for the full period of time prescribed by your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any drug, you should never take an antibiotic that was prescribed for someone else or that was prescribed for a previous illness.</p>
<p>A doctor bases his decision to prescribe antibiotics on several things, including your symptoms and your lab test results. If you have any questions or concerns about antibiotics or any medication, it's best to discuss them with a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
