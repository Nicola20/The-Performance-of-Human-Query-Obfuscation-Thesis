# Running the Python Scripts

### Step-By-Step List

-  If you want to use a virtual environment run `python3 -m venv venv` and then
   activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`. Else go to step 2.
- Install requirements: Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3)`.
- Run `export FLASK_APP=flask_server`. If there is a problem with the JAVA_HOME setting \
  use `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` to fix it
- It could be possible that the index has to be created beforehand. If this is the case see the README.md in \
  the /src/document-samle/ folder and follow it's content.
